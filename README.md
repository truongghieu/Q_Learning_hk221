# Q_Learning_hk221

Main.py file for train with Learning Rate coefficients change from 0.1 to 0.9
train_with_discount.py for train with DISCOUNT coefficients change from 0.5 to 0.9

# Comment 
The best Learning Rate is 0.1 in this case because it converges to a point but the more time we need to train in the first times 
The larger Discount coefficients the more noise in fig but like the Learning Rate we don't need too much time to get the point of convergence 

# FIG
Here is two case above <br>
